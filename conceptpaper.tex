\title{\textbf{BISIMILARITY IN LOGIC FOR STRATEGIC REASONING}}
\maketitle
\section{INTRODUCTION}
This paper presents an attempt to bridge the gap between logical and cognitive
treatments of strategic reasoning in games. Rational strategic reasoning is the
process whereby an agent reasons about the best strategy to adopt in a given
multi-agent scenario, taking into account the likely behavior of other partici-
pants in the scenario, and, in particular, how the agents choice of strategy will
aect the choices of others.
The language and its semantics help to precisely distinguish dierent cogni-
tive reasoning strategies, that can then be tested on the basis of computational
cognitive models and experiments with human subjects.
